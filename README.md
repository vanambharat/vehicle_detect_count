# vehicle_detect_count
In this project, I worked on detecting and counting vehicles in a given image or a video. I used OpenCV for image processing and Haar cascade which is used for object detection. We can also create our own customized haar cascade classifier.
I started with downloading the images we will be working on and performed different operations on that image. I saw how I can use haar cascade which is used for object detection. I saw how different haar cascade is used for car detection, bus detection. Similarly, we can use many pretrained haar cascades for different object detection.
As haar cascade is used for object detection we have a very vast scope for this project. It can be used for any type of object detection. We can also create our own custom haar cascade for any specific object.
